# A11n Flavored Pico

This repository is a SCSS project aimed at creating a custom variant of 
[Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), a minimalist and lightweight starter
kit that encourages writing semantic HTML. `a11n-flavored-pico` tweaks
the default theme in a handful of ways, applying a little more 
transformation than is accessible through the compilation settings of
the base library.

## TODOs:

- [ ] Continue working on V1 here, this is pretty new.
- [ ] Deploy the `test` website somewhere for reference.
- [ ] Make the output discoverable, maybe list on NPM?
